# Byte Baazar
Welcome to my Byte Baazar repository! This repo is structured into two three main sections: **rust-lang** and **golang** and **python**. 
The repo is full of projects made in three languages and many technology I've created to expand my horizons and learn. 
The Readme is updated after each project is finished!
